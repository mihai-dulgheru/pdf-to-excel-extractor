# PDF to Excel Extractor - Improvement Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive improvement plan for the PDF to Excel Extractor application. Based on an analysis
of the current codebase and the improvement tasks outlined in the project documentation, this plan identifies key areas
for enhancement and provides a detailed roadmap for implementation.

## Current System Overview

The PDF to Excel Extractor is a PyQt6-based desktop application designed to extract data from PDF invoices and convert
it to Excel format. The application consists of the following key parts:

1. **User Interface (`qt_ui.py`)**: A PyQt6-based GUI that allows users to select PDF files, configure processing
   options, and initiate the extraction process.
2. **Invoice Processor (`modules/invoice_processor.py`)**: Handles the extraction of data from PDF invoices, including
   company information, invoice numbers, NC8 codes, and other relevant data.
3. **Excel Generator (`modules/excel_generator.py`)**: Converts the extracted data to Excel format, applying formatting,
   formulas, and calculations.
4. **Utility Functions (`functions/`)**: Various helper functions for data processing, formatting, and validation.

## Detailed Improvement Plan

### 1. Architecture and Structure Improvements

#### 1.1 Implement Proper Logging System

**Rationale**: The current application uses print statements for debugging and error reporting, which is inadequate for
production use. A structured logging system would improve error tracking and debugging.

**Implementation Plan**:

- Replace print statements with structured logging using Python's `logging` module
- Add configurable log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Implement log rotation to manage log file size
- Add log file viewing capability to the UI for user troubleshooting

#### 1.2 Refactor Code Architecture

**Rationale**: The current architecture mixes UI logic with business logic, making the code harder to maintain and test.
A more structured architecture pattern would improve code organization.

**Implementation Plan**:

- Separate UI logic from business logic more clearly
- Implement Model-View-Controller (MVC) or Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern
- Create clear interfaces between components
- Use dependency injection to reduce coupling between components

#### 1.3 Improve Configuration Management

**Rationale**: Many configuration values are hardcoded, making the application less flexible and harder to maintain.

**Implementation Plan**:

- Move hardcoded values to configuration files
- Implement environment-specific configurations
- Add validation for configuration values
- Create a configuration UI for user-adjustable settings

#### 1.4 Enhance Error Handling

**Rationale**: The current error handling is inconsistent and doesn't provide clear feedback to users.

**Implementation Plan**:

- Implement centralized error handling
- Add more specific exception types for different error scenarios
- Improve error messages for better user feedback
- Add error recovery suggestions for common issues

### 2. Code Quality Improvements

#### 2.1 Increase Test Coverage

**Rationale**: The current test coverage is limited, making it difficult to ensure that changes don't introduce
regressions.

**Implementation Plan**:

- Add unit tests for all utility functions
- Add integration tests for PDF processing
- Implement UI tests for critical user flows
- Set up continuous integration for automated testing

#### 2.2 Refactor Large Methods

**Rationale**: Several methods in the codebase are overly complex and challenging to maintain, particularly in
`invoice_processor.py` and `qt_ui.py`.

**Implementation Plan**:

- Break down `_process_single_invoice` method in `invoice_processor.py`
- Simplify `_extract_nc8_codes` method
- Refactor `create_file_section` and `handle_processing_finished` methods in `qt_ui.py`
- Extract reusable UI components

#### 2.3 Improve Code Documentation

**Rationale**: Some parts of the codebase lack proper documentation, making it harder for new developers to understand.

**Implementation Plan**:

- Add docstrings to all methods
- Document complex algorithms
- Add type hints throughout the codebase
- Create architecture documentation

#### 2.4 Address Code Duplication

**Rationale**: There are instances of code duplication that could be refactored into shared utilities.

**Implementation Plan**:

- Create shared utilities for repeated operations
- Implement DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Extract common patterns into reusable functions

### 3. Performance Improvements

#### 3.1 Optimize PDF Processing
